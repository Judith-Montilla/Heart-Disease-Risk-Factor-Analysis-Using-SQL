-- Heart Disease Risk Factor Analysis Using SQL

-- Introduction:
-- This SQL analysis aims to explore risk factors associated with heart disease 
-- using the Heart Disease Cleveland dataset. The dataset includes patient demographics 
-- and various health metrics, allowing us to perform a comprehensive analysis to identify 
-- key indicators of heart disease. The insights derived from this analysis can help 
-- healthcare providers make informed decisions about patient care and resource allocation.

-- 1. Check the basic structure of the dataset
SELECT *
FROM `case-study-4-437215.case_study_4.Heart Disease Cleveland UCI`
LIMIT 10;

-- 2. Count the number of patients with and without heart disease
SELECT 
    condition, 
    COUNT(*) AS patient_count
FROM `case-study-4-437215.case_study_4.Heart Disease Cleveland UCI`
GROUP BY condition;

-- 3. Analyze Key Health Metrics for Patients With and Without Heart Disease
SELECT 
    condition,
    AVG(age) AS avg_age,
    AVG(trestbps) AS avg_resting_bp,
    AVG(chol) AS avg_cholesterol,
    AVG(thalach) AS avg_max_heart_rate,
    AVG(oldpeak) AS avg_st_depression
FROM `case-study-4-437215.case_study_4.Heart Disease Cleveland UCI`
GROUP BY condition;

-- 4. Find the Distribution of Chest Pain Types and Heart Disease
SELECT 
    cp AS chest_pain_type, 
    condition,
    COUNT(*) AS patient_count
FROM `case-study-4-437215.case_study_4.Heart Disease Cleveland UCI`
GROUP BY cp, condition
ORDER BY chest_pain_type, condition;

-- 5. Compare Key Risk Factors (e.g., Cholesterol and Blood Pressure) for Heart Disease
SELECT 
    condition,
    AVG(chol) AS avg_cholesterol,
    AVG(trestbps) AS avg_resting_bp,
    AVG(thalach) AS avg_max_heart_rate,
    AVG(oldpeak) AS avg_st_depression
FROM `case-study-4-437215.case_study_4.Heart Disease Cleveland UCI`
GROUP BY condition
HAVING AVG(chol) > 200 OR AVG(trestbps) > 130;

-- 6. Rank Patients Based on Risk Factors
SELECT 
    age, 
    sex,
    chol AS cholesterol,
    trestbps AS resting_bp,
    thalach AS max_heart_rate,
    oldpeak AS st_depression,
    condition,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY chol DESC, trestbps DESC, oldpeak DESC) AS risk_rank
FROM `case-study-4-437215.case_study_4.Heart Disease Cleveland UCI`
WHERE condition = 1;

-- 7. Summarize Demographic and Health Risk Factors
SELECT 
    sex, 
    AVG(age) AS avg_age, 
    AVG(chol) AS avg_cholesterol, 
    AVG(trestbps) AS avg_resting_bp,
    AVG(thalach) AS avg_max_heart_rate,
    AVG(oldpeak) AS avg_st_depression,
    COUNT(*) AS patient_count
FROM `case-study-4-437215.case_study_4.Heart Disease Cleveland UCI`
GROUP BY sex
ORDER BY avg_cholesterol DESC;

-- Conclusion:
-- The analysis identified significant risk factors associated with heart disease, 
-- highlighting the importance of cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health metrics 
-- in predicting heart disease. These insights can guide healthcare professionals in 
-- developing targeted interventions for patients at higher risk.

-- Future Work Recommendations:
-- - Expand the dataset to include additional patient metrics, such as comorbidities or previous hospitalization history, 
--   to improve the accuracy of heart disease predictions.
-- - Conduct scenario analyses to simulate various patient influx situations and assess how resource allocation strategies perform.
-- - Integrate this model with Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems for real-time patient monitoring and intervention.
-- - Explore more advanced machine learning models for predicting heart disease risk based on a wider array of health metrics.
